Assignment – 13
Using the UNION clause.
1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all 
customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, 
while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.

-->>select cname,city,rating 'High Rating' from customers where rating > 200 
union
select cname,city,rating 'Low Rating' from customers where rating <=200;

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each 
customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order.

-->>select Sname, snum, Cname from salespeople join customers using(snum) where snum in(select snum from customers group by snum having count(snum)>1)order by sname, cname;

3) Form a union of threes queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in 
San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of 
all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate 
any redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides 
the point.)

-->>select Snum from salespeople where city='San Jose' 
union 
select cnum from customers where city='San jose'
union
select onum from orders where odate like '03-oct-%';
